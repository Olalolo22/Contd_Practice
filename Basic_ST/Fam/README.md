All right, this is the first one ive thought about myself MashAllah.
The "main.c" takes user inputs of family members ages and tells the sum and average.
"main2.c" though naturally takes for the first three then promps to know if the user has any siblings before printing accordingly. 

its very crude but im sure you get the idea.
